# Next.js 15 App Router: Dynamic Route Middleware Issue

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior when using middleware with dynamic routes in the Next.js 15 App Router.  The issue involves incorrect routing or unexpected behavior when accessing a dynamic route that depends on middleware for data fetching or redirection.

## Bug Description

The bug is that middleware doesn't seem to be working as expected with dynamic routes.  When the dynamic route segment is present, the middleware doesn't trigger correctly causing unexpected rendering or data fetching issues. 

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Observe the incorrect behavior of the app when interacting with the dynamic route.

## Expected Behavior

Middleware should correctly handle requests to dynamic routes, similar to the behavior observed in the pages directory.

## Actual Behavior

Middleware is not triggered as expected, leading to incorrect data fetching, redirects, or unexpected page rendering.

## Solution

The proposed solution involves adjusting the middleware and/or dynamic routing configuration. See the `bugSolution.js` for code demonstrating a potential fix.  This may involve a change in how the dynamic segments are handled within the middleware or adjusting how you access the `params` object in the middleware function itself.
